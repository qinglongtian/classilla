**Due to Google Code no longer allowing new files to be hosted, downloads for Classilla 9.3.3+ (including the source code) are available from [SourceForge](http://classilla.sourceforge.net/).** Previous releases are still available from Google Code, but are no longer supported, and you use them at your own risk.

**Please do not file bugs here unless you are an authorized contributor, coder or distiller.** If you are an end user, please use the Classilla [Report-A-Bug](http://www.classilla.org/report) triage system and let a reviewer file here on your behalf. Feel free to **comment** on an existing bug, however, if you believe you have something to share.
